			h3 Your Task
			p Santa and the elves need your help! They have sent you a specific task, and request your assistance for the week. In return for your
				| willingness to help, Santa will make sure you receive a gift of your own.
			p Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to act as a 
				i Secret Santa
				|  and create a game for 
				strong= task.user.name
				| . The game should be suitable for playing on a 
				strong #{task.wishlist.getMachinePerformanceDisplay()} #{task.wishlist.getPreferredOSDisplay()} machine
				| , and implement at least one of the following ideas:
				ul
					for wish in task.wishlist.wishes
						li: strong= wish
			if compState.seq < competitionStates.DevelopmentIntermission.seq
				h3 Development
				p You have until 
					strong #{displayDate(competition.devEnd)} (UTC)
					|  to develop this game. Review the 
					a(href=genLink('/rules')) rules
					|  if necessary, then get to work!
				p You are encouraged to keep a blog of your progress over on the 
					a(href=genLink('/blog')) blog
					|  page. Your blog will be kept private during the competition, and released with your entry.
				p When you're ready, submit your entry on the 
					a(href=genLink('/submit')) submission
					|  page. You may submit as many times as you like; your last submission will be the one that is used.
			else
				h3 Results
				if competitionEntry.submission != null
					p You submitted 
						strong= competitionEntry.submission.name
						| , hopefully fulfilling the wishes of 
						strong= task.user.name
						| ! Good job!
				else
					p Unfortunately, you never submitted a game for 
						strong= task.user.name
						| . But don't worry, we'll give them another game they should like. Better luck next year!
