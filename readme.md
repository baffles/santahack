# SantaHack

This is the source code for [SantaHack.net](http://www.santahack.net/).

Most of this code was hacked together fairly quickly to get the site up and running, and as such, it's pretty rough.
I'm in the process of going through and overhauling everything, however. The goal is to have everything buttoned up
well before the 2013 SantaHack.

I'm currently experimenting with an organization inspired by
[express-boilerplate](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/express-boilerplate).

I use Trello to track what needs to be done. Board is [here](https://trello.com/board/santahack/509e680e24efc50b48001b7b).
